# Recovery of gold from ore

Prepare a prototype machine learning model for Zifra. The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises.

The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. Use data with mining and cleaning parameters.

The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.

You need to:

1. Prepare data;
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis;
3. Build and train the model.

To complete the project, refer to *pandas*, *matplotlib* and *sklearn.* libraries.
