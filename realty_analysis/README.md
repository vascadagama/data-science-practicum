# Study of ads for the sale of apartments

At your disposal is the data of the Yandex.Realty service - an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Your job is to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically on the basis of cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and reservoir.

The study plan will include the following steps:
- Studying the composition of data and preprocessing (data types, omissions, exclusion of unnecessary parameters)
- Adding derived parameters to the table (price per square meter, etc.)
- Exploratory analysis:
    - Study of the ranges of values of various parameters, median and outliers
    - Research of correlations between the price and parameters of apartments
    - Identification of the center and research of announcements in the central part of the city
